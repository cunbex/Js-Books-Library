# Non responsive JS-Book-Library by Odin project

In this project, i'll be creating a pretty neat toy. I'm going to build a browser version of JS-Book-Library, https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library Assignment, with personal layout.

media screen page was made on: 1600x900 laptop screen.

ps: this is not an advanced javascript project, this project was done in order to understand DOM manipulation, grid and flex responsiveness, and entry level object constructors and inheritance.
